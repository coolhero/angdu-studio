# Specification Quality Checklist: Core Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-04
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- FR-001 through FR-022 cover all identified functional areas from the source analysis.
- SC-001 through SC-010 provide measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed — all requirements have clear, reasonable defaults based on the source analysis.
- Key architectural decisions (Electron process model, IPC channel enum, file storage patterns) are referenced at the requirement level without prescribing implementation.
- The Assumptions section documents 5 informed defaults made during spec creation.
